                <h2>The game</h2>
                <p> 
                    <a  href="https://github.com/MathiasRadder/Unity-Prototype " >Unity Prototype source code</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The point of the game is that you must reach to the end of the level before dying. 
                    There is also a timer that counts down. When it reaches zero, 
                    it will start dealing damage to your health every second. 
                    To avoid this, you have to pick up the blue spheres around along the level. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your dash length is relative to how much time you have left, 
                    which encourages the player to pick up the blue spheres more. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two types of obstacles in the level that ether reduces your health, or your time left. 
                    Which gives you the option to choose. This makes it more fun, by keeping a balance of your health and time.
                </p>

                <h2>Learning Unity</h2>
            </p>
            <p>
                This is my first project where I learned working in unity and programming in C#. There I learned the importance of components.      
            </p>
            <p>
                To make the game I did: 
            </p>
            <p>
                -	The movement and physics of the player.
            </p>
            <p>
                -	The dash that is relative to how much time you have left.
            </p>
            <p>
                -	A spike trap that smoothly goes up and down, by having multiple states.
            </p>
            <p>
                -	Picking up spheres to increase the timer.
            </p>
            <p>
                -	A hud to display hp, time, stamina and buffs/debuffs.
            </p>

        <h2>Learning the steps of game design and prototyping</h2>
        <p>
            During these lessons we were giving two keywords to be a starting for our game.  
            Then we brainstormed around these two keywords and thinking about a game and the mechanics around it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our main mechanic is meant to be unique, so I looked at other similar games and there unique main mechanics. 
            So, I can learn how those games where so much fun yet similar except there unique mechanics.  
        </p>
        <p>
            This is where I thought about the time mechanic and how it can change the flow of the game. 
            By keeping people on edge with a timer and making mechanics around that.
        </p>    
        <p>
            <h2>Learning constructive feedback</h2>
        </p>    
        <p>
            Each week we worked on the prototype, we were tasked to give constructive feedback to other students. 
            This makes gave a lot of perspectives on how other people came up with their mechanics and how they perceive your game.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because every game needs it testers and multiple people to give constructive feedback and perspectives on the game.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Whenever I receive feedback, I took it in mind, tested it, 
            see if people liked it. Getting feedback from it and so on again. 
            This made my game change by a lot in a good way.
        </p>   
        <p>
            I love giving constructive feedback to other students, because I like giving the person more options 
            and perspective to improve their prototype and seeing it in action.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course not all feedback can be implemented, but its best to still keep it in mind in the future. 
        </p>
