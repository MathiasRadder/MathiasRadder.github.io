                <h2>What I did in the project</h2>
                <p>
                    A big Unity project that is meant to help people train at sea. 
                    This was already an ongoing project and my task was to add a UI that gives info on structures at sea, 
                    about their status, issues and the option to handle the situation by for example assigning people to the task or issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This task took a week or two to finish. 
                    I worked alongside someone who works there and learned a lot from the coding convention and how the project worked.
                </p>
                <h2>What I learned</h2>
                <p>
                    -  Streaming data structure: one of the challenges was correctly processing and converting the inconsistent data that was received. 
                    I programmed data processing for the different offshore structures The equipment of each offshore structure consist of a receiver of the data, 
                    a converter of the data and a class that displays the data for the UI of that building. 
                    Depending on the specific functionalities of the different unique offshore structures, a custom converter is used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -   UI 2D to 3D and vice versa: The interesting points about the UI was converting a 2D object in 3D space to the camera in 2D space 
                    so that the icons would indicate in 2D space where the offshore structures is in 3D space.

                <h2>Struggles and how I overcame them</h2>
            <p>
                One of the issues of the task was order of operation some objects that depended on the camera or other objects, 
                couldnâ€™t function because sometimes that object did not exist yet. 
                So I could not lean or trust when an object was created that I needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way I overcame this issue was by making sure that everything else worked and that It blocked all the features 
                of a structure when that feature was not complete yet.
                An example would be getting the memory location of where the camera would be created, 
                rather then the camera itself so it could overcome the issue.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>What I will do better next time</h2>
            <p>
            <p>
                In this project I learned not to only rely on order of operation and the safety around it. 
                This has made me be more watchful and careful about it.
