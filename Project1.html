                    The group consisted of 2 programmers and 3 artists. The game that we made is as an vertical slice, as it was asked of us.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Our game was made in the unity engine 2021.2.14f1.

                <h2>Programming</h2>
            </p>
            <p>
                Programming wise, first and foremost I learned a lot about the car movement and the physics. The car movement was more complex than I thought, but with some hard work, research and feedback I figured it out. 

            </p>
            <p>
                 There are so many unique elements about the movement of the car, that it turned in to a process of adding features bit by bit. As a result, I learned that starting with a strong foundation and adding details later is definitely the best way to go about these things. It allowed me to keep adding features without needing to tear anything down. 

            </p>
            <p>
                
                What concerns the physics of the car I used a similar style of work, but here the biggest obstacle was recreating ‘realism’. I solved this problem by working step by step as well. I started by creating rules with functionality and fair gameplay in mind, for example: If a moving a car rams a parked car, the parked car should be the only one suffering from a penalty.
                Finally I also realised that I went above and beyond with my comments for the sake of my own comfort and that of my teammates. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>Game design</h2>
            </p>
            <p>
                During this endeavour I learned much about Unity and its features. I’m now more comfortable using this engine.
                In addition, while working on this project, I have learned that the best type of feedback comes from diverse sources.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                I tried to get different people within our target audience (games, people who play racing games, people who don’t play games, the young and the old, …) to play our game and as a result I got a wide selection of feedback, which I would not have gotten if I have only focused on one specific group within our demographic.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>Teamwork</h2>
            </p>
            <p>
                I got acquainted with the blessings and the curses of working with a team.
            </p>
            <p>
                I learned the importance of clear communication, making rules to avoid confusion and complications, and writing things down and always keeping back-ups in case of trouble. This was an approach that helped us out a great many times over the course of making Car Arena Rumble.
