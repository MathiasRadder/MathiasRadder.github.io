                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    You are a fishing tribe in this game, where you need sail to the fishing point. 
                    But other fishing tribes also want that fishing spot. 
       
                </p>
                <p>
                    So you let your shaman control ice, move icebergs, melt and freeze ice 
                    to prevent the tribes from reaching the fishing spot except for you.

                <h2>Learning UE4</h2>
            </p>
            <p>
                We worked in ue4 which we are already familiar with.          
            </p>
            <p>
                To make the game I did: 
            </p>
            <p>
                -	Making a grid system to make the map on.
            </p>
            <p>
                -   For the sailing, I created a form of A* so that it feels like the boats were searching for the fishing spot and finally trying to go to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                -	A hud that shows the mechanics you can use.
            </p>
            <p>
                -	Creating game states: preparation stage, sailing stage and the ending stage.

        <h2>Learning the steps of game design and prototyping</h2>
        <p>
            During these lessons we were giving two keywords to be a starting for our game.  
            Then we brainstormed around these two keywords and thinking about a game and the mechanics around it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our main mechanic is meant to be unique, so I looked at other similar games and there unique main mechanics. 
            So, I can learn how those games where so much fun yet similar except there unique mechanics.  
        </p>
        <p>
            This is where I thought about the time mechanic and how it can change the flow of the game. 
            By keeping people on edge with a timer and making mechanics around that.
        </p>    
        <p>
            <h2>Learning constructive feedback</h2>
        </p>    
        <p>
            Each week we worked on the prototype, we were tasked to give constructive feedback to other students. 
            This makes gave a lot of perspectives on how other people came up with their mechanics and how they perceive your game.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because every game needs it testers and multiple people to give constructive feedback and perspectives on the game.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Whenever I receive feedback, I took it in mind, tested it, 
            see if people liked it. Getting feedback from it and so on again. 
            This made my game change by a lot in a good way.
        </p>   
        <p>
            I love giving constructive feedback to other students, because I like giving the person more options 
            and perspective to improve their prototype and seeing it in action.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course not all feedback can be implemented, but its best to still keep it in mind in the future. 
        </p>
